# CONTEST TIPS

1. For contest that gives penalties on wrong submissions, try to test edge cases first before submitting. The obvious ones include: array size of 1, inputs of 1, 0, or -1, etc.
2. If you are trying to improve your rating, try to finish problems quickly without wrong submissions. Even though you can't solve the harder ones, the ranking will still be good.
3. Whenever you see problems in sequence (Q1: xxx I, Q2: xxx II), see them both first. If the second one is just a slight modification of the first one on data constraints, try solving the second one first. and the first one will definitely pass.
