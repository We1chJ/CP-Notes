# Backtracking

Backtracking is one of the techniques of a complete search algorithm.

> A backtracking algorithm begins with an empty solution and extends the solution step by step. The search recursively goes through all different ways how a solution can be constructed. --CPH

Some sorts of optimizations usually come with backtracking to save a lot of time and recursive calls, aka pruning the search tree.
