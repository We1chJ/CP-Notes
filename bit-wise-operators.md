# Bit-wise Operators

Bit wise operators include common ones: &, |, ^, etc. They act on bits representation of data such as integers.



## Cool Tricks and Properties

### XOR Operator

XOR operator (^) is associative, commutative, and reversible. Whenever you face a problem involving the XOR concept, try to use these properties. They will save you a lot of time and sometimes they are the key to the solutions.

These properties mean that the order of a series of XOR operations does not matter. Most importantly, prefix sum can be applied if needed.
