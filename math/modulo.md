# Modulo

Modulo is known as a math operation: `%` . It yields the remainder after a division operation.

But, there is more than that. There is a whole field in math that deals with modulo arithmetics.



## Remainder/Divisibility

Mod is commonly used to check if a number is divisible by another number when the remainder is 0.&#x20;

When it comes to remainders, for a division like: `a/b=c...r` , `r < b` is true always. One classic principle is that, if the number being divided increases in a repeated patterns, the order of remainders occurring will follow a special pattern, too:&#x20;

1\) There will be at most `b` remainders

2\) The remainders will occur in a cyclic fashion, due to the Pigeonhole Principle.&#x20;

Especially rule 2), it can shrink down the problem size by a lot when needed to check a large quantity.
